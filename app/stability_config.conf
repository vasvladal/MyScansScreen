# Stability configuration for Jetpack Compose
# This file helps the Compose compiler understand which classes are stable

# Stable types (won't trigger recomposition when unchanged)
stable {
    # Basic Kotlin types are automatically stable
    # Add your custom stable classes here
    # Example:
    # com.example.kropimagecropper.model.DataItem
}

# Unstable types (will trigger recomposition even if unchanged)
unstable {
    # Add classes that should be treated as unstable
    # Example:
    # com.example.kropimagecropper.model.VolatileDataHolder
}

# Runtime stability (classes that can be marked stable at runtime)
runtime {
    # Add classes that should be checked for stability at runtime
}

# Skippable composables (composables that can skip recomposition if parameters are stable and unchanged)
skippable {
    # Add composable functions that should be skippable
    # Example:
    # com.example.kropimagecropper.ui.MyComposable
}
